          I believe that the more I experience the more I
          become creative. Every experience inspires me. Currently, the most inspiring
          experience is the time I spent in Japan. Living in Japan for one year, I learned
          their language and culture, and I realized that the culture is embodied in
          the language. This enlightenment led me to have an interest in computer
          languages. Surrounded by digital environments, I wanted to learn how people
          make visually attractive designs with a computer, especially by using computer
          languages. After learning various hard skills and doing some projects, I realized
          that creating gives me a sense of achievement and keeps me motivated.

          The focal point of this icon project is to portray a significant wild animal indigenous

          captured the essence of the animal's most exceptional attributes, producing flat icons that
           are both visually appealing and easily recognizable. A restrained color palette, consisting 
           of 5 to 6 colors, has been employed in the creation of each icon, resulting in a harmonious 
           color scheme. Additionally, the application of the golden ratio and a circular frame has been 
           utilized to create a cohesive and uniform appearance for the entire set of icons.

          creating a straightforward promotional animation for their new menu,

          Despite being a Japanese restaurant, the establishment prides itself 
          on a modern ambiance, deviating from traditional Japanese aesthetics. 
          The new sauces introduced are inspired by western-style sauces commonly 
          associated with American family restaurants, as opposed to authentic Japanese cuisine. 
          To complement the aforementioned aspects, I employed a retro design approach 
          for the animation, ensuring a cohesive visual narrative.
